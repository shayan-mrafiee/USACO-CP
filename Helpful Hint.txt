To change what will be pre-included in a project you create in Xcode, find the following file:
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/MultiPlatform/Source/C++ File.xctemplate/Default/___FILEBASENAME___.cpp

This file is a read-only file by default. If you want to edit it, you can do so by using the following command in terminal:

sudo vim /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/MultiPlatform/Source/C++ File.xctemplate/Default/___FILEBASENAME___.cpp

To start editing, press 'i' on your keyboard. 

You can change it to whatever you want. For USACO or general competitive programming, I'd include the following:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
	in.tie(nullptr);  
}

After you're done, press "esc" on your keyboard and then execute the following two commands to save (:w) and close (:q) the file in terminal:
:w
:q
